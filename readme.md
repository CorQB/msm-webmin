# MSM Webmin Module

This is Webmin plugin for managing minecraft servers via [MSM](http://msmhq.com/). Full documentation for installation, usage, and feature coverage can be found on the [MSM Webmin](https://bplower.github.io/msm-webmin) page.

## Project Status

This project is very early in development, and still has quite a bit that needs to be done before it can be considered to be ready for production. I haven't had time to put together a timeline or roadmap for development, but some of the major points are as follows:

- Full feature parity with MSM
- More consistent forms and error indicators (there are some silent errors)
- Add views for actions logged through the plugin
- Properly move all text messages to lang files to support localization

At this point in time, I don't have much free time I can dedicate to the project, so any contributions would be hugely appreciated.
